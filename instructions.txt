Hello! Welcome to basic instructions to use DareCMS or sideboard or whatever!

Make a test admin user at
localhost:8282/cms/accounts/insert_test_admin

the login is
admin@example.com
password

Vagrant instructions!

You must have vagrant installed.
The command to boot vagrant is `vagrant up`
The command to login to the virtual machine is `vagrant ssh`
The command to shutdown vagrant is `vagrant halt`

Sideboard instructions!

The command to install all dependencies is `paver install_deps` this must be executed while the Present Working Directory is `/sideboard`
The command to pull latest updates for all plugins is `paver pull_plugins` this must be executed in the Present Working Directory of `/sideboard`
The command to reset the database for new data or updates to the model is `sep reset_db` and can be executed from anywhere

The way to log into the PSQL database is
`psql -U cms --host localhost` and the password is `cms`

To boot the instance and login use
`vagrant up` and then `vagrant ssh`

Once logged in you'll be in a folder that has two subfolders, one of these will be `vagrant` and the other will be `uber`.
Enter the uber folder by doing `cd uber`. Once here, you'll be in the folder that contains this set of instructions. 

Next, enter the subfolder `sideboard` by inputting `cd sideboard`.

To run the webserver type `run_server` this will locate the python executable for the webserver, and start the main python file.

If that command cannot be found, you are most likely using a Windows Machine. Enter the following commands.
`cd ~`
`sudo apt-get install dos2unix`
`sudo dos2unix .bash_aliases`
now log in and out by entering
`Ctrl+D` then `vagrant ssh`

You can use PyCharm as your IDE, but this requires the Student or Professional Edition. For instructions on that email me@daredoes.work
